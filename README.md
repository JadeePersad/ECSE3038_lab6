# This lab implements a graphical user interface (GUI) for a tank monitoring system using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The tank cards are populated with data (location, latitude, percentage full) from a database or from a submit form and each card generates a Tank User Id. Data entered from the submit form is stored in database. All images are stored in assets.
